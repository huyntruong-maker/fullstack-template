## Implementation plan (backend-first)

Delivery order is **backend-first**: design/integrate the database and build the API for all MVP
features before any UI work. The frontend is built afterward against stable API contracts. The
`Wave` column in the story map above is the **feature build order** (1 = Auth … 5 = enhancements);
each MVP feature is delivered backend-first within that order. `/orchestrate` should sequence
contract → DB → backend → tests → (then) frontend.

### Phase 0 — Foundation (systems-architect, cicd-engineer, database-expert)
Solution scaffold (API + Web projects), EF Core wired, DB schema designed for all MVP entities with
the initial migration, health check, GitHub Actions CI (build + test + lint for .NET and React).
Acceptance: pipeline green on an empty slice; `docs/DATABASE.md` and `docs/API.md` reflect the schema/contract.

### Phase 1 — Backend & Database (build before any UI)
For each MVP feature in build order: design/integrate DB → implement endpoints → integration-test → update API/DB docs.

1. **Auth API — F4 US1–US4** (backend-lead, security-auditor, database-expert). Gates everything that saves data.
   DB: Users, EmailVerificationTokens, RefreshTokens. Endpoints: register (unique email, password ≥8,
   bcrypt/argon2, generic errors), email verification token flow, login (JWT access + refresh, stay signed
   in after refresh), refresh, logout (end session, block protected routes).
2. **Destination Suggestion API — F1 US2, US3** (backend-lead). Provider integration behind
   `IDestinationProvider` / `IGeocodingProvider` (OpenTripMap geocoding + POIs, Foursquare enrich).
   `GET /locations/search` (cities+countries, rank exact-first, max 5, dedupe, case-insensitive, partial);
   `GET /attractions` (coords+radius, city default 20 km, max 20/page, ranking, "No attractions found" empty).
   Caching to meet NFR-1 (≤500 ms) and NFR-2 (≤1000 ms). DB: optional `DestinationCache`.
3. **Destination Details API — F2 US1, US2, US4** (backend-lead).
   `GET /destinations/{providerPlaceId}` (name, category, description, photos, address?, website?, opening hours;
   opens even with missing fields). NFR-3 ≤2 s.
4. **Trips API + DB — F3 US1, US2, US3, US7, US8, US10** (backend-lead, database-expert, security-auditor).
   DB: Trips, ItineraryDays, TripDestinations (+ migration). Endpoints: trips CRUD (name required),
   set dates → generate one ItineraryDay per date (start ≤ end; warn when reducing days drops items),
   add destination (**select a day** — `itineraryDayId` required since drag-drop US4 is out of MVP),
   remove destination, load saved trips with empty state. Auth-gate every write; enforce NFR-6 (own-data-only) on every query.

Exit criteria: all MVP endpoints implemented, documented in `docs/API.md` / `docs/DATABASE.md`, and covered by
integration tests (real pipeline via `WebApplicationFactory`, Testcontainers DB). NFR-1 and NFR-6 verified.

### Phase 2 — Frontend (after API contracts are stable)
Built against the Phase 1 APIs, in the same feature order: auth (sign-up/login/logout pages + route guards) →
search box + results grid (thumbnails/placeholders) → destination detail view + photo carousel +
"Opening hours not available" fallback ("Add to Trip" disabled when logged out) → trip list + planner board
(create trip, set dates, add destination to a selected day, remove, load saved trips).

### Phase 3 — Backlog / enhancements (post-MVP, backend-then-frontend per item)
F1 autocomplete (US1), filters (US4), sort (US5); F2 map (US3);
F3 drag-drop scheduling (US4), reorder within a day (US5), drag between days (US6) — meet NFR-4 (≤100 ms); F3 autosave (US9).

## Definition of done (every story)
- Acceptance criteria from the sheet are met and demoed.
- Unit/integration tests cover the logic; relevant E2E for the user flow.
- Build + lint clean; `docs/API.md` / `docs/DATABASE.md` updated by the owning agent.
- For auth/data stories: security-auditor checks authorization (NFR-6) and secrets handling.
